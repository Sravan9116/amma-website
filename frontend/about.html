            <h2>Early Life & Biography</h2>
            <p>Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, affectionately known as Amma, is a world-renowned spiritual leader,
                humanitarian, and visionary. Born on September 27, 1953, in a small fishing village in Kerala, India,
                her early life was marked by profound compassion and selfless service. From a young age, she displayed
                an innate understanding of the suffering of others, often sharing her food and comforting those in need.
            </p>

            <p>Even as a child, Amma exhibited extraordinary empathy and a deep connection to the divine. She spent
                hours in meditation and contemplation, experiencing profound states of spiritual awareness. Despite
                facing hardships and challenges, her unwavering faith and commitment to serving others remained
                steadfast.</p>

            <p>In her late teens and early twenties, Amma began to embrace people who came to her seeking solace and
                guidance. This simple act of compassion evolved into the unique form of darshan (blessing) for which she
                is now known worldwide – a loving embrace. Over the years, Amma has embraced millions of people from all
                walks of life, offering them comfort, healing, and inspiration.</p>

            <p>Recognizing the need for organized efforts to alleviate suffering, Amma founded the Mata Amritanandamayi
                Math (MAM), a global network of charitable and humanitarian organizations. Through MAM, Amma has
                launched numerous initiatives focused on providing food, shelter, healthcare, education, and disaster
                relief to those in need. Her "Embracing the World" campaign has touched the lives of countless
                individuals and communities around the globe.</p>

            <p>Amma is also the founder of Amrita University, a multi-campus university known for its commitment to
                research and innovation for social good. The university offers a wide range of academic programs and
                conducts cutting-edge research in areas such as sustainable development, healthcare, and technology.</p>

            <p>Throughout her life, Amma has received numerous awards and accolades in recognition of her humanitarian
                work and spiritual leadership. She has addressed the United Nations, the World Parliament of Religions,
                and other international forums, sharing her message of love, compassion, and selfless service.</p>

            <p>Today, Amma continues to travel the world, offering her darshan and inspiring people to embrace their own
                potential for love and compassion. Her teachings emphasize the importance of seeing the divine in
                everyone and serving all with humility and dedication. Amma's life is a testament to the power of love
                to transform individuals and communities, and her legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.
