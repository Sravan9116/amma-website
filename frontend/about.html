            <h2>Early Life & Biography</h2>
            <p>Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, affectionately known as Amma, is a world-renowned spiritual leader,
                humanitarian, and visionary. Born on September 27, 1953, in a small fishing village in Kerala, India,
                her early life was marked by profound compassion and selfless service. From a young age, she displayed
                an innate understanding of the suffering of others, often sharing her food and comforting those in need.
            </p>

            <p>Even as a child, Amma exhibited extraordinary empathy and a deep connection to the divine. She spent
                hours in meditation and contemplation, experiencing profound states of spiritual awareness. Despite
                facing hardships and challenges, her unwavering faith and commitment to serving others remained
                steadfast.</p>

            <p>In her late teens and early twenties, Amma began to embrace people who came to her seeking solace and
                guidance. This simple act of compassion evolved into the unique form of darshan (blessing) for which she
                is now known worldwide – a loving embrace. Over the years, Amma has embraced millions of people from all
                walks of life, offering them comfort, healing, and inspiration.</p>

            <p>Recognizing the need for organized efforts to alleviate suffering, Amma founded the Mata Amritanandamayi
                Math (MAM), a global network of charitable and humanitarian organizations. Through MAM, Amma has
                launched numerous initiatives focused on providing food, shelter, healthcare, education, and disaster
                relief to those in need. Her "Embracing the World" campaign has touched the lives of countless
                individuals and communities around the globe.</p>

            <p>Amma is also the founder of Amrita University, a multi-campus university known for its commitment to
                research and innovation for social good. The university offers a wide range of academic programs and
                conducts cutting-edge research in areas such as sustainable development, healthcare, and technology.</p>

            <p>Throughout her life, Amma has received numerous awards and accolades in recognition of her humanitarian
                work and spiritual leadership. She has addressed the United Nations, the World Parliament of Religions,
                and other international forums, sharing her message of love, compassion, and selfless service.</p>

            <p>Today, Amma continues to travel the world, offering her darshan and inspiring people to embrace their own
                potential for love and compassion. Her teachings emphasize the importance of seeing the divine in
                everyone and serving all with humility and dedication. Amma's life is a testament to the power of love
                to transform individuals and communities, and her legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.

            <h2>Philosophy & Teachings</h2>
            <p>Amma's teachings are rooted in the principles of love, compassion, and selfless service. She emphasizes
                the importance of seeing the divine in everyone and serving all with humility and dedication. Amma's
                philosophy transcends religious boundaries, promoting a universal message of unity and harmony among all
                beings.</p>

            <p>Central to Amma's teachings is the concept of "Seva" or selfless service. She encourages her followers to
                engage in acts of kindness and compassion, not only as a means of helping others but also as a path to
                spiritual growth. Through seva, individuals can cultivate empathy, humility, and a deeper connection to
                the divine.</p>

            <p>Amma also emphasizes the importance of meditation and prayer as tools for inner transformation. She
                teaches simple meditation techniques that can be practiced by anyone, regardless of their spiritual or
                religious background. According to Amma, regular meditation helps individuals develop inner peace,
                clarity, and a greater sense of purpose in life.</p>

            <p>Another key aspect of Amma's philosophy is the cultivation of love and compassion in everyday life. She
                encourages her followers to practice kindness, forgiveness, and understanding in their interactions with
                others. By embodying these qualities, individuals can create a more harmonious and compassionate world.
            </p>

            <p>Amma's teachings also highlight the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of living in
                harmony with nature. She advocates for environmental conservation and sustainable living as essential
                components of spiritual practice. Amma believes that by caring for the environment, we are also caring
                for ourselves and future generations.</p>

            <p>Overall, Amma's philosophy is a holistic approach to life that integrates spiritual practice with social
                responsibility. Her teachings inspire individuals to lead lives of love, compassion, and service,
                ultimately contributing to the betterment of humanity as a whole.</p>

                        <li><b>Birth and Early Years:</b> Born in a small fishing village in Kerala, India, Amma's early
                            life
                            was marked by deep compassion and an innate understanding of the suffering of others. From a
                            young

                            in
                            need.
                            Her spiritual journey began early, with profound experiences of divine love and a natural
                            inclination
                            towards meditation and contemplation.</li>
                        <li><b>Start of Darshan (Hugging) & Global Outreach:</b> In the 1980s, Amma began offering

                            (a blessing) to people who came to seek solace and guidance. Her unique form of darshan, a
                            loving
                            embrace, became her signature, drawing people from all walks of life. As word spread, Amma's

                            inspiration to millions.</li>
